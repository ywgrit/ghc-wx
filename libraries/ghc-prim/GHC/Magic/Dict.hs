{- Note [withDict has an ambiguous type]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The type of `withDict` is ambiguous.  Consider
   foo :: forall cls meth. WithDict cls meth
       => forall rr (r::rr). meth -> (cls => r) -> r
   foo m k = withDict m k

If we instantiate `withDict` with fresh unification variables, including cls0 for cls,
there is nothing that forces the `cls` Wanted from the call to `k` to unify with the
`cls0` Given from the call to `withDict`.  You have to give it a class argument:

   foo m k = withDict @cls m k

That's fine.  But it means we need -XAllowAmbiguousTypes for the withDict definition,
at least with deep subsumption.
