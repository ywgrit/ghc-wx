synopsis:             A placeholder for the system's C++ standard library implementation.
description:          Building against C++ libraries requires that the C++ standard
                      library be included when linking. Typically when compiling a C++
                      project this is done automatically by the C++ compiler. However,
                      as GHC uses the C compiler for linking, users needing the C++
                      standard library must declare this dependency explicitly.
                      .
                      This "virtual" package can be used to depend upon the host system's
                      C++ standard library implementation in a platform agnostic manner.
