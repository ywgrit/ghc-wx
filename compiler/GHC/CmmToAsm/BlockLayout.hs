  Note [CFG based code layout]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The major steps in placing blocks are as follow:
  * Compute a CFG based on the Cmm AST, see getCfgProc.
    This CFG will have edge weights representing a guess
    on how important they are.
  * After we convert Cmm to Asm we run `optimizeCFG` which
    adds a few more "educated guesses" to the equation.
  * Then we run loop analysis on the CFG (`loopInfo`) which tells us
    about loop headers, loop nesting levels and the sort.
  * Based on the CFG and loop information refine the edge weights
    in the CFG and normalize them relative to the most often visited
    node. (See `mkGlobalWeights`)
  * Feed this CFG into the block layout code (`sequenceTop`) in this
    module. Which will then produce a code layout based on the input weights.


  Note [Chain based CFG serialization]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  For additional information also look at
  https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/commentary/compiler/code-layout

  We have a CFG with edge weights based on which we try to place blocks next to
  each other.

  Edge weights not only represent likelihood of control transfer between blocks
  but also how much a block would benefit from being placed sequentially after
  it's predecessor.
  For example blocks which are preceded by an info table are more likely to end
  up in a different cache line than their predecessor and we can't eliminate the jump
  so there is less benefit to placing them sequentially.

  For example consider this example:

  A:  ...
      jmp cond D (weak successor)
      jmp B
  B:  ...
      jmp C
  C:  ...
      jmp X
  D:  ...
      jmp B (weak successor)

  We determine a block layout by building up chunks (calling them chains) of
  possible control flows for which blocks will be placed sequentially.

  Eg for our example we might end up with two chains like:
  [A->B->C->X],[D]. Blocks inside chains will always be placed sequentially.
  However there is no particular order in which chains are placed since
  (hopefully) the blocks for which sequentiality is important have already
  been placed in the same chain.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     1) First try to create a list of good chains.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Good chains are these which allow us to eliminate jump instructions.
  Which further eliminate often executed jumps first.

  We do so by:

  *)  Ignore edges which represent instructions which can not be replaced
      by fall through control flow. Primarily calls and edges to blocks which
      are prefixed by a info table we have to jump across.

  *)  Then process remaining edges in order of frequency taken and:

    +)  If source and target have not been placed build a new chain from them.

    +)  If source and target have been placed, and are ends of differing chains
        try to merge the two chains.

    +)  If one side of the edge is a end/front of a chain, add the other block of
        to edge to the same chain

        Eg if we look at edge (B -> C) and already have the chain (A -> B)
        then we extend the chain to (A -> B -> C).

    +)  If the edge was used to modify or build a new chain remove the edge from
        our working list.

  *) If there any blocks not being placed into a chain after these steps we place
     them into a chain consisting of only this block.

  Ranking edges by their taken frequency, if
  two edges compete for fall through on the same target block, the one taken
  more often will automatically win out. Resulting in fewer instructions being
  executed.

  Creating singleton chains is required for situations where we have code of the
  form:

    A: goto B:
    <infoTable>
    B: goto C:
    <infoTable>
    C: ...

  As the code in block B is only connected to the rest of the program via edges
  which will be ignored in this step we make sure that B still ends up in a chain
  this way.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     2) We also try to fuse chains.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As a result from the above step we still end up with multiple chains which
  represent sequential control flow chunks. But they are not yet suitable for
  code layout as we need to place *all* blocks into a single sequence.

  In this step we combine chains result from the above step via these steps:

  *)  Look at the ranked list of *all* edges, including calls/jumps across info tables
      and the like.

  *)  Look at each edge and

    +) Given an edge (A -> B) try to find two chains for which
      * Block A is at the end of one chain
      * Block B is at the front of the other chain.
    +) If we find such a chain we "fuse" them into a single chain, remove the
       edge from working set and continue.
    +) If we can't find such chains we skip the edge and continue.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     3) Place indirect successors (neighbours) after each other
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We might have chains [A,B,C,X],[E] in a CFG of the sort:

    A ---> B ---> C --------> X(exit)
                   \- ->E- -/

  While E does not follow X it's still beneficial to place them near each other.
  This can be advantageous if eg C,X,E will end up in the same cache line.


  Note [Triangle Control Flow]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Checking if an argument is already evaluated leads to a somewhat
  special case  which looks like this:

    A:
        if (R1 & 7 != 0) goto Leval; else goto Lwork;
    Leval: // global
        call (I64[R1])(R1) returns to Lwork, args: 8, res: 8, upd: 8;
    Lwork: // global
        ...

        A
        |\
        | Leval
        |/ - (This edge can be missing because of optimizations)
        Lwork

  Once we hit the metal the call instruction is just 2-3 bytes large
  depending on the register used. So we lay out the assembly like this:

        movq %rbx,%rax
        andl $7,%eax
        cmpq $1,%rax
        jne Lwork
    Leval:
        jmp *(%rbx) # encoded in 2-3 bytes.
    <info table>
    Lwork:
        ...

  We could explicitly check for this control flow pattern.

  This is advantageous because:
  * It's optimal if the argument isn't evaluated.
  * If it's evaluated we only have the extra cost of jumping over
    the 2-3 bytes for the call.
  * Guarantees the smaller encoding for the conditional jump.

  However given that Lwork usually has an info table we
  penalize this edge. So Leval should get placed first
  either way and things work out for the best.

  Optimizing for the evaluated case instead would penalize
  the other code path. It adds an jump as we can't fall through
  to Lwork because of the info table.
  Assuming that Lwork is large the chance that the "call" ends up
  in the same cache line is also fairly small.


  Note [Layout relevant edge weights]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The input to the chain based code layout algorithm is a CFG
  with edges annotated with their frequency. The frequency
  of traversal corresponds quite well to the cost of not placing
  the connected blocks next to each other.

  However even if having the same frequency certain edges are
  inherently more or less relevant to code layout.

  In particular:

  * Edges which cross an info table are less relevant than others.

    If we place the blocks across this edge next to each other
    they are still separated by the info table which negates
    much of the benefit. It makes it less likely both blocks
    will share a cache line reducing the benefits from locality.
    But it also prevents us from eliminating jump instructions.

  * Conditional branches and switches are slightly less relevant.

    We can completely remove unconditional jumps by placing them
    next to each other. This is not true for conditional branch edges.
    We apply a small modifier to them to ensure edges for which we can
    eliminate the overhead completely are considered first. See also #18053.

  * Edges constituted by a call are ignored.

    Considering these hardly helped with performance and ignoring
    them helps quite a bit to improve compiler performance.

  So we perform a preprocessing step where we apply a multiplicator
  to these kinds of edges.

-- We have the chains (A-B-C-D) and (E-F) and an Edge C->E.

--
-- While we could take into account the space between the two blocks which

-- It is very simple (and stupid): We make a graph out of
-- the blocks where there is an edge from one block to another iff the
-- first block ends by jumping to the second.  Then we topologically
-- sort this graph.  Then traverse the list: for each block, we first
-- output the block, then if it has an out edge, we move the
-- destination of the out edge to the front of the list, and continue.

-- FYI, the classic layout for basic blocks uses postorder DFS; this
-- algorithm is implemented in Hoopl.
