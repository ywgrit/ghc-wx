    technology preview

      GHC will occassionally ship features advertised as being in a *technology
      preview* state. Such features are generally opt-in in nature (e.g. new
      language extensions) and may have various shortcomings. These may include
      known bugs (which we will try to document), lacking optimisation, and
      unhandled interactions with other language features. As such, behavior
      of such features may change in the future. However, we do expect features
      to converge to non-preview state over the course of a few GHC major releases.
